Here is our khafan git repo for dr.abdollahi's final project! 
we're gonna generate music with GAN BD

#  Introduction
First of all, we'd turn each sample music from our dataset into an image! By having STFT applied to each sample, it is turned in to a beautiful image containing both time and frequency information. This is where the GAN comes in! Our GAN is trained to get the music distributions. After training well, it can generate new music in the same style of our dataset.
